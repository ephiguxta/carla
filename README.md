# Carla Fundamentals
### About
Carla is a pattern created by a young programmer, who felt tired of languages ​​and their paradigms. Where, he was always very fond of fundamentalism and modernizing every little thing as much as possible. Inspired by the fundamentals of C, the beauty of Rust, and admired by the Heskell difference, he started the **Carla** project.

### Fundamentals  
- Practicality
- Modernity 
- Fundamentalism
- Mathematical ease

# And what is Carla's objective?
Carla's true objective is to draw attention to the "Carla protocol". Therefore, some standards that, if followed, could change the direction of current computing.

### What was the initial spark for the creation of Carla?

Have you ever entered a Discord, Telegram or Whatsapp chat and seen a lot of people struggling with JavaScript, Python, Ruby? This is exactly what served as the snap.

Imagine a world where the easiest thing makes sense! Where who knows, you can create a `1024-bit (Example)` Integer without having to use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/BigInt" target="_blank">BigInt</a>s? addressing and allocation of memory accessible, but not mandatory...

### Carla will not just be a language. It is a new concept of languages.
